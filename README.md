Week 2 Homework UTSA bootcamp

Since I don't have any coding projects i've worked on, I have placed several placeholder images and text, but I really wanted to show more of the 
functionality and styling of the site more than anything. 

I'd say the hardest part was configuring the site so when the screen size changes it still looks good. 

most of the links are placeholders, but they do work. I'd just rather not put my real info on there since im uploading to github publicly every week. 

Took me 3 hours to upload to github, but I finally got it. 

hope you like the site. I really enjoyed building it.
